How to use all of this ?
===

Yes this is another readme than the one on the main branch
well, you need this readme to now how to use this repository don't you ?
and you're on the toUse branch :3

well using the librairies isn't to complecated, once you've cloned this branch you can simply leave them in the "librairies" folder that have been created.

you'll then just need to access them using this kind of line :
`#include "librairies/fifo_lifo.h"` 

making you then able to use the Lifo and Fifo classes
